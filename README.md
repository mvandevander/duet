# duetgame
Duet is a puzzle platforming game for two players. This is the game code, its engine and level editor. Does not include any assets or levels.

All is written in C++, using SDL for platform support and OpenGL for rendering.

Here is a video showing off some of the features, since most people (including myself) will probably not be able to get the code compiling anymore:
